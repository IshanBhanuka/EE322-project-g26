## EE322-project-g26

This project is a bidirectional visitor counter using an atmega328p microcontroller. The project uses infrared sensors to detect visitors entering and leaving a room, and displays the count on a 16x2 LCD display. The project is useful for tracking the number of visitors to a room and light up the bulb if the count of visiotrs is greater than zero. If the count is zero light system will be on and if the count is greater than 0 lighting system will be on.Assembly code and the arduino code for this project is available in the repository.
